#Legacy repository for RSGallery2 a free joomla! gallery extension
Repository for components, modules and plugins for joomla J1.x - J!2.5 

Version RSG2.Legacy.2015.04.03
The repository is taken from a SVN Version. The repository contains all existing sources of the RSGallery2 component for joomla 1.5, 1.6 bis 2.5. 
The development in this repository has ended as the compatibility for joomla! 3.x is broken

ToDo:
  The releases (Installable Zip files) from site "joomlacode" will follow and 
  the sucessing sources for joomla! 3.x will be in seperate repositories

  Give us some time to move the releases
