Installation Notes:
	Currently only way to install is to use the 1.14.3 tag or download zip, install and overwrite everything (except tamplates if you've modded any), see forums for additional info
	Cou will have to manually modify 2 database tables to use this branch, didn't want to automate just yet, some fairly sensitive tables modified
	Temporarily Maintained at \com_rsgallery2_legacy\branches\ItemTags\admin\sql\TEST_add_tag_database.sql
	
	BE SURE TO REVIEW THE SQL TO CHANGE YOUR EXTENSION. HARDCODED with jos_
	
Technical Notes:
	Tables created are
		jos_rsgallery2_tags
		jos_rsgallery2_tag_match
	Table Maodified is
		jos_rsgallery2_files
			(note, this is your MAIN files table, be sure know what you are doing beofre add the column.
		
		And please review the SQL file to verify, hate to mess someones db up unintentionally. 
		
		BACK UP FIRST  !!!

Additional:

	Test site for this branch is at dev.fantasyartwork.net, it is totally "sandbox", so if someone want a backend password, let me know.

NOTE:
Will be redoing all of this, to give the tags it's own table and remove the extra column in _files table
