
RS Newest Images is roughly based on a small part of the original RSItems module written by Daniel Tulp.

It will display only the newest image from each gallery as a 2 column table. It also can add a code block in the middle of the list to display a web ad or something.
(To disable tell it to insert the add after row 0)

Any comments or blame?
