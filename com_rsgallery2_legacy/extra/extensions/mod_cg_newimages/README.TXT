This modules is an EXTREMLY trimmed down version of the old RSItem.  It will display the newest item from each of the galleries.
This will also work with Joomla 1.5 (legacy mode) and RSGallery 1.14.x 


Also can inssert a block of code in the middle (I used a Google Adsense ad).

Its still under development, and very sloppy, just putting it up in case someone has a use for it.


See my page at www.fantasyartwork.net for sample of what it looks like.
